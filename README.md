# Sports time table for 2 Round Robin
Note: This project was a submission to a competition https://www.sportscheduling.ugent.be/ITC2021/ for sports timetabling

The problem statement is to come up with a schedule for a 2 Round Robin Tournament where different kinds of constraints such as Capacity Constraints, Break Constraints, Fairness Constraints, Seperation constraints and Game Constraints are available.
I have used MILP solver from Google OR-tools to come up with the solution by Linearizing Non-Linear Constraints.
More Details can be found from the paper present in the Repo.
